# Patient Consultation Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing patient consultation data stored in a JSON file. The primary objectives are to clean and transform the data, handle missing values, and extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes calculating statistics such as the percentage of missing values, the percentage of female patients, the count of adult patients, the average number of medicines prescribed, and the distribution of active and inactive medicines. Additionally, the project involves validating phone numbers and examining the correlation between the number of prescribed medicines and patient age.
